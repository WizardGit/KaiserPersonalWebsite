            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p>If you're looking for high-quality, hand-crafted sandwiches custom for each customer, you are in the right place!</p>
            <p>Our motto corresponds with Provers 25:21-22 which says,"If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat; if he is 
                thirsty, give him water to drink. In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head, and the Lord will 
                reward you." </p>
            <p>We help you bless your enemies.  Simply order our food for them.</p>
            <p>Most people dislike giving their enemies good things, so we have renamed and remodeled our site to help you feel
                better about blessing your enemies. We don't tell our clients the name of the foods, so they may
                be surprised and start liking you!</p>
