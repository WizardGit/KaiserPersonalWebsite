            <img id="EELogo" src="EELogo.jpg" />            
            <p>I am currently designing an application that will assist in my job at Elegant Elephant Baking Co.!  As the dedicated flour mixer, it's my job to mix all the flour used and make sure we have enough on hand, but this can be difficult!
                Hence, my software will provide a huge time saver in communicating the ingredients needed and in the correct units to the dedicated ingredients buyer at my job.  It's been a challenge, but I'm enjoying it!</p>
