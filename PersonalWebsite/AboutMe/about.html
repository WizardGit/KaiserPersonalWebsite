            <h2>Early Years</h2>
            <p>I very much disliked the process of learning to read and starting school, but I loved to run and compete - participating in the local Kids Sports soccer program.</p>
            <p>I enjoyed attending AWANA in the Cubbies and Sparks program.</p>

            <h2>Elementary Years</h2>
            <p>I was homeschooled these years, hating writing but liking the reading.</p>
            <p>I started running around the neighborhood block a lot for my exercise for homeschool and partipated with my dad and brother in some 5k races.
                In addition, I participated in our local elementary school's track and field program where I honed my running abilty in all types of distances.
            </p>                
            <p>I started participating in BSF (Bible Study Fellowship) in addition to AWANA.

            <h2>Middle School and Early Highschool Years</h2>
            <p>I was still homeschooled and still disliked writing.  In this time frame my dad assigned me his college history 
                and physics textbooks that I worked through digilently. None of the rest of my siblings have even touched the first page!
            </p>
            <p>I still ran a few 5k running races, participated in two relay triathlons (as the swimmer), and made a personal record of running 3 miles in 20min. 30sec.
                In addition, I fell in love with badminton.  
            </p>
            <p>In these years I participated as a leader in AWANA and also kept attending BSF.  It was pretty much an exhausting cycle of school and yard work
                since I started taking over my brother's yard care business as he graduated Lane Community College and transferred to the University of Oregon.</p>

            <h2>College Years at Lane Community College</h2>            
            <p>After a lot of thought and prayer I decided to participate in a charter school's early college program at Lane Community College, majoring
                in computer science with a speciality in programming.  I enjoyed most of my classes and learned a ton.</p>
            <p>I continued to play sports by myself, played my instruments every now and then, did yard care for local neighbors and friends, and worked as Senior Archive Specialist at DOWL Engineering for about two years before I completed my job. 
            </p>
            <p>Unfortunately, AWANA stopped running at the church where it was hosted, so I was left with just attending BSF as part of the children's program at "Women's BSF.
                During the fall of 2019, I volunteered as a leader for a new, local AWANA club, and enjoyed helping children memorize God's word and grow in their relationship with Christ.                
                I have also volunteered as an usher at my church - <a href="https://newhopeeugene.com">New Hope Eugene</a> for about two years now.

            <h2>College Years at the University of Oregon</h2>            
            <p> I graduated the spring of 2020 with a GPA of 4.2 and a Valedictorian in my High School Charter School's graduatin class.</p>
            <p> In the early spring of 2020, I was officially accepted into the University of Oregon's Computer Science department and offered the Summit Scholarship.
                I will attend UO starting in the fall of 2020 and plan to complete a Bachelor's in Computer Science there.</p>
            <p>I have also been accepted into a business mentorship program that will help me to become financially independent and make a big impact on the lives of my friends, family, and community.  
                I am excited and honored to work alongside my older sister in this endeavor and work with such extraordinary peers.</p>
