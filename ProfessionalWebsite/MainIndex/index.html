            <h2>Highlighted Projects!</h2>
            <p><a href="">You can view the following projects here!</a></p>
            <p>If you are anything like me, losing board games is not the most fun thing in the world.  Thus, while playing "CLUE" with my siblings and always losing horribly, I 
                had the idea to design some software that will utilize every possible clue and deduction available to arrive at the answer as swiftly as is possible.  I did finally
                manage to code up the entire project, but it involved several classes and took quite a bit longer than anticipated.  However, the result was definitely worth it!</p>
            <p>At my past job at Elegant Elephant Baking Co., I noticed several inefficiencies in taking flour inventory, so I created some easy-to-use software for the company that
                speeds up the process, eliminates error-prone areas, and encourages efficiency!</p>
            <p>
                I am currently collaborating with two undergraduates from the University of Oregon to create a Dragon Racing Game in Unity. 
                You can view the GitHub Repository <a href="https://github.com/WizardGit/StingerRunRacing">here</a> and the game <a href="https://play.unity.com/mg/other/webgl-builds-241">here!</a>
