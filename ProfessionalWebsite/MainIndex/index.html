            <h2>Highlighted Projects!</h2>
            <p>If you are anything like me, losing board games is not the most fun thing in the world.  Thus, while playing "CLUE" with my siblings and always losing horribly, I 
                had the idea to design some software that will utilize every possible clue and deduction available to arrive at the answer as swiftly as is possible.  I did finally
                manage to code up the entire project, but it involved several classes and took quite a bit longer than anticipated.  However, the result was definitely worth it!</p>
            <p>At my past job at Elegant Elephant Baking Co., I noticed several inefficiencies in taking flour inventory, so I created some easy-to-use software for the company that
                speeds up the process, eliminates error-prone areas, and encourages efficiency!</p>
            <p>I collaborated with two undergraduates from the University of Oregon to create a Dragon Racing Game in Unity. I continue to push out updates to it by myself now, and you can view the website for 
                the game <a href="../StingerRunRacingWebsite/index.html">here</a>.</p>            
            <p> I am currently working on some budget software (using Visual Studio, C#, and SQL) that will help people take better care of their finances.</p>

                to assist in their many projects.</p>
