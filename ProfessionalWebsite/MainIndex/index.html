            <h2>Highlighted Projects!</h2>
            <p><a href="">You can view the following projects here!</a></p>
            <p>If you are anything like me, losing board games is not the most fun thing in the world.  Thus, while playing "CLUE" with my siblings and always losing horribly, I 
                had the idea to design some software that will utilize every possible clue and deduction available to arrive at the answer as swiftly as is possible.  I did finally
                manage to code up the entire project, but it involved several classes and took quite a bit longer than anticipated.  However, the result was definitely worth it!</p>
            <p>At my current job at Elegant Elephant Baking Co., I noticed several inefficiencies in taking flour inventory, so I created some easy-to-use software for my boss that
                will speed up the process, eliminate error-prone areas, and encourage efficiency at my job!</p>
            <p>
                I am currently collaborating with two undergraduates from the University of Oregon to create a Dragon Racing Game in Unity. 
                You can view the GitHub Repository <a href="https://github.com/WizardGit/StingerRunRacing">here</a> and the game <a href="https://play.unity.com/mg/other/webgl-builds-231">here!</a>

            <p>I designed an application that assists flour mixers at Elegant Elephant Baking Co.!  Flour mixers at this bakery must mix all the flour used and make sure there is enough on hand, but this can be difficult!
                Hence, my software is a huge time saver in communicating the ingredients needed and in the correct units for purchasing.  It was a challenge, but the result was certainly worth it</p>
